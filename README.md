# What is StatsFM Cheat?

This is simple, with statsFM you can import your data into it. 

Silly statsFM forgets they have no way of checking if its legit 

(they do they just wont add it) 

# How do I use this program?

First you want to run the program, `go run test.go` in the CMD panel would be great

This will walk you through, a track ID is as FOLLOWED

### open.spotify.com/track/<sub>**XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**</sub>

You **only** need a trackID, not the whole link. Copy the trackID

Let the program goto work.

<br>
Then, YOU MUST HAVE PREMIUM TO DO THIS, goto https://stats.fm/settings/imports

In the same folder, a file called `output.json` is created, drag and drop! 

Usally takes 1-3 minutes to appear on profile, 30-Hr to appear on leaderboards.

Another fun fact about this. You can do this as many times as you want! They dont check for
dupe streams!!!
